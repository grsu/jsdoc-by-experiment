# How to build this documentation from scratch

Simply running `jsdoc .` will render documentation pages to `out/` directory.

To include lengthy tutorials into documentation, use `jsdoc -u tutorials .` (do
not miss the ending dot character).

Want to incorporate contents of this README.md file into documentation's Index
page?

```
jsdoc -u tutorials . README.md
```

See {@link http://usejsdoc.org/about-including-readme.html} about including
README file into documentation generated by JSDoc 3.
